Goed om te weten is dat we de app zelf “runnen en hosten”. We bouwen en beheren dus niet alleen de voorkant maar ook de achterkant. Dit betekent dat je snel nieuwe functionaliteiten kunt maken, uitproberen en in productie moet houden, oftewel; “You build it, you run it!”.

Jij zorgt ervoor dat Volksbank-applicaties voor bijvoorbeeld internetbankieren en wonen er strak uitzien en dat klanten er probleemloos in kunnen navigeren.</p>\n<p>Samen met je collega’s bouw, test, beheer en documenteer je applicaties. Dit doe je met behulp van een breed scala aan frontend-ontwikkeltechnieken en onze eigen componentenbibliotheek op basis van Angular. Je werkt aan interessante projecten. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan de online Huismap, waarmee klanten en hypotheekadviseurs snel en simpel informatie en documenten met elkaar kunnen uitwisselen. Of aan Payconiq: een systeem waarmee je met je smartphone in winkels, online en aan vrienden kunt betalen.</p>\n<p>Als frontend-developer heb jij veel oog voor de klantbeleving van onze applicaties.

Dat ben jij in een notendop. Daarnaast beschik je over een kritische blik, het vermogen om complexe problemen te analyseren en de vindingrijkheid om eenvoudige creatieve oplossingen te bedenken. Oplossingen waar de klant écht iets aan heeft. Nieuwe technologische ontwikkelingen volg je op de voet, bijvoorbeeld doordat je onze lezingen, pizzasessies en hackathons bijwoont. Jouw kennis deel je graag. Iedereen kan bij jou rekenen op een helder verhaal. Want jij kunt je makkelijk inleven in anderen, of dat nou je backend-collega, een hypotheekadviseur uit de business of de klant is.</p>\n<p>Verder heb je:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hbo werk- en denkniveau;</li>\n<li>Minimaal drie jaar ervaring met frontend-ontwikkeling;</li>\n<li>Ervaring met frontend-ontwikkeltechnieken en -frameworks zoals: Angular, Jasmine, Protractor, Cucumber, SASS, BDD, TDD, NgRx, HTML5, JavaScript, TypeScript. stylesheets, CSS, SAS, NodeJS en Grunt of Gulp;</li>\n<li>Bij voorkeur ervaring met backend-technologieën, zoals middleware, security, service-oriented architecture, Spring Boot en databases.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Solliciteren?</h2>\n<p>Upload je motivatie en cv via <a href=\"https://vonq.io/36TuFsY\">deze link!</a>.
